#-- SITE COLLECTIONS: While a Fadelisk "site" is a directory containing 
#   subdirectories of configuration files, content, and other data for
#   a single web site, a "site collection" is a directory which contains
#   one or more Fadelisk sites. When Fadelisk is started, each site
#   collection is scanned for sites to bring online. It is recommended
#   that you consider using the default location if you can. Placing
#   services into /srv provides flexibility in directory layout, allows
#   modularization of mounted file systems, make backups easier, and
#   is compatible with the File Heirarchy Standard as observed on 
#   modern systems. An example directory layout might look like this:
#
#   /srv
#     /db  -------.
#     /samba      |
#       /share_1  }-- Other services which might be located on /srv
#     /vcs        |
#       /git -----'
#     /www - directory for the WWW service
#       /bin - scripts and binaries specific to web service
#       /log - log files for each site, if kept separate
#       /site - directory in which sites are placed
#         /www.example.com - an example site
#           /etc - configuration files specific to this site
#           /content - web content for this site
#           /lib - library files specific to this site
#           /tmp - temporary files such as cached objects
#
#   It is also suggested that the directory for each individual site be
#   named with the canonical FQDN of that web host, or if each FQDN is
#   equally canonical, the most commonly known name.
#   default: []
site_collections:
    - "/srv/www/site"

#-- EXTRA LIBRARIES: Directories with other Python modules to be appended
#   to sys.path
#   default: []
extra_libraries:
    - "/srv/www/lib/python"

#-- TEMPLATES: Directories with heirarchies of mako templates. These will
#   be searched in order for a template at a given path.
#   default: []
template_directories:
    - "/srv/project/fadelisk/templates"

#-- BIND ADDRESS:
#   Address to listen on (a single address for now, except for the case of
#   0.0.0.0, which binds the socket to all available interfaces.) Host names
#   are allowed instead of addresses, but addresses are safer.
#   default: "127.0.0.1"
# bind_address: "127.0.0.1"

#-- LISTEN PORT:
#   default: 1066
# listen_port: "1066"
