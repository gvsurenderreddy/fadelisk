# == FADELISK SERVER CONFIGURATION ==
# Copy this file to /etc/fadelisk/fadelisk.yaml or /etc/fadelisk.yaml
# and make any needed changes below. If this file is not present, the
# server will use its built-in defaults, which match those listed below.

# SITE COLLECTIONS: List any directories where you keep Fadelisk sites.
# Note that these aren't the names of the site directories themselves,
# such as "example.fadelisk.org", but the directory where
# "example.fadelisk.org" is placed. You are strongly encouraged to use
# the default (/srv/www/sites).
#
# site_collections:
#     - "/srv/www/sites"

# EXTRA PYTHON DIRECTORIES: Directories with other Python modules/packages to
# be appended to sys.path
#
# extra_python_directories:
#     - "/srv/www/lib/python"

# EXTRA TEMPLATE DIRECTORIES: Directories with heirarchies of mako templates.
# These will be searched in order for a template at a given path.
#
# extra_template_directories:
#     - "/srv/project/fadelisk/templates"

# BIND ADDRESS:
# Address to listen on (a single address for now, except for the case of
# 0.0.0.0, which binds the socket to all available interfaces.) Host names
# are allowed instead of addresses, but addresses are safer.
#
# bind_address: "127.0.0.1"

# LISTEN PORT:
#
# listen_port: "1066"
