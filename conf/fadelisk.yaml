# == FADELISK SERVER CONFIGURATION ==
# Copy this file to /etc/fadelisk/fadelisk.yaml or /etc/fadelisk.yaml
# and make any needed changes below. If this file is not present, the
# server will use its built-in defaults, which match those listed below.

# BIND ADDRESS: Address to listen on (a single address for now, except
# for the case of 0.0.0.0, which binds the socket to all available
# interfaces.)
#
# bind_address: '127.0.0.1'

# LISTEN PORT: Port for the listening socket. Set to 80 for a stand-alone
# installation.
#
# listen_port: 1066

# PROCESS USER: The user under which the server will be run. For safety,
# this user should have minimal access to the host system. Never use
# 'root' or any user that has write access to your sites.
#
# process_user: 'nobody'

# LOG LEVEL: Possible levels: error, warning, info, debug
#
# log_level: 'warning'

# SERVER ID: The name of the server software returned in response headers.
#
# server: 'fadelisk/1.0'

# DIRECTORY INDEX: When a directory path is requested, these document
# names will be sought in order. This should be the normal way that
# documents are served (a named directory with an index inside it) so
# that site implementation is generic and hidden.
#
# directory_index:
#     - 'index.html'
#     - 'index.htm'

# SITE COLLECTIONS: List any directories where you keep Fadelisk sites.
# Note that these aren't the names of the site directories themselves,
# such as "example.fadelisk.org", but the directory where
# "example.fadelisk.org" is placed. You are strongly encouraged to use
# the default (/srv/www/sites).
#
# site_collections:
#     - "/srv/www/sites"

# EXTRA PYTHON DIRECTORIES: Directories with other Python
# modules/packages to be appended to sys.path
#
# extra_python_directories: - "/srv/www/lib/python"

# EXTRA TEMPLATE DIRECTORIES: Directories with heirarchies of mako
# templates. Template directories are searched in order for a template
# at a given path. Directories specified here come AFTER template
# directories in sites, and BEFORE the built-in templates.
#
# extra_template_directories: - "/srv/project/fadelisk/templates"
