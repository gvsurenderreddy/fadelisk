# Fadelisk

Fadelisk is a web server where all HTML documents are templates. It uses a simple, natural directory layout reminiscent of static web servers. All HTML documents are rendered by [Mako], a rich templating system that brings the power of [Python] to each and every page.

Fadelisk is trivial to set up, and easy to use. Configuration is minimal and smart. It can stand alone, or co-exist happily with other popular web servers such as [nginx]. It handles HTTP 1.1 virtual hosts in a simple way, making adding new vhosts as easy as creating a directory.

Fadelisk is based on [Twisted Web][Twisted], a flexible and very performant web server written in Python.

Fadelisk will make everything better. That's its goal &mdash; to get out of the way so you can spend your time doing the thing you came to do in the first place: designing your site.
